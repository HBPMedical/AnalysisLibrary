Parallel OPTICS Clustering Algorithm Using Graph Algorithmic Techniques (OpenMP version)

How to run the tool:
1. Compile the source files using the following command

        make

2. Run using following command

        ./omp_optics -i filename -b -m minpts -e epsilon -o output -t threads

        Example:

        ./omp_optics -i clus50k.bin -b -m 5 -e 60 -t 24 -o omp_clus50k_mst.o

        Run the following to get detail description on the program arguments.

        ./omp_optics ?

3. Input file format:

        Binary file:
        Number of points, N and number of dimensions, D (each 4 bytes) followed by the points coordinates (N x D floating point numbers).

        Text file:
        Each line is a point (no need to mention the number of points or the number of dimensions).

4. Output file format:

	Text file:
	First line contains the number of points followed by nubmer of edges in the MSTs.
	Each of the rest lines contains the followings four values u, v, w, and d where
		u is the point reachable_to from point v with reachability distance w and d is the core distance of v.
	The points in the MST is 0 indexed.
